        Melon is a general utility bot ranging from utilities such as reaction-roles and message management to Melons (and upcoming Tags) to make it a portable knowledge database.
        <br>
        <br>
        Melon's initial feature-set was limited to reaction-roles and management as the bot served as a utility bot for the use of Mariavi and was capable of advertising certain projects.
        The addition of Melons makes the bot an ideal companion for servers based around productivity as the Melons are split in to categories which can be enabled and disabled by server administrators.

    <h2 id="reactionroles">Reaction-Roles<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#reactionroles">üîó</a></h2>
    <p>
      Reaction-roles can be setup by administrators of a server and allow the users to click on reactions of a certain message to receive a role.
      The command <code>!addreactrole [emoji, role, message, channel]</code> will have Melon add a reaction with the <code>[emoji]</code> of your choice to the messsage, as well as an entry to her database that creates a link between the message's reaction and a given role.
    </p>

    <div class="img-container">
      <div class="wiki-img">
        <img style="max-height: 400px;" src="img/melon/reaction-roles.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Reactions beneath the message can be clicked on for the user to receive a role.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 id="remreactrole">Removing a Reaction-Role<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#remreactrole">üîó</a></h3>
    <p>
      Reaction-roles can be removed by using the command <code>!remreactrole [emoji, message, channel]</code> after calling it Melon will remove the reaction from the message as well as the link to avoid assigning the reaction in the future.
    </p>

    <h2 id="messages">Messages<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#messages">üîó</a></h2>
    <p>
      Melon has two handy commands that allow you to quote people, evaluate poll results and more!
      <br>
      <br>
      <code>!quote [id, channel]</code>: This command will return a message in the form of an embed. The <code>id</code> of the message must be fed, whereas the boolean parameter <code>breakdown</code> is optional.
      If a message has reactions added to it, they will be shown as part of the embed Melon returns quoting the message. Otherwise an embed with the author's name, a URL to the message as well as the text (including markdown) will be returned:
    </p>
    <div class="img-container">
      <div class="wiki-img">
        <img src="img/melon/quote.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Melon will return the message info including reactions.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      <code>!rawmsg [id, channel]</code>: <code>!rawmsg</code> will return the message within a simple code block allowing you to see the markdown which proves useful for when a message needs to be posted somewhere else and you aren't the author.
    </p>
    <h3 id="msgmanagement">Management<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#msgmanagement">üîó</a></h3>
    <p>
      Given you have the <code>Manage Messages</code> permission in the channel you are trying to use either of the following commands, Melon allows you bulk remove messages:
      <br>
      <br>
      <code>!nuke</code>: Removes a maximum of 1000 messages in the current channel, ignores pinned messages.
      <br>
      <code>!clear [amt]</code>: Removes the given amount of messages, again ignoring pinned messages.
    </p>

    <h2 id="melons">Melons<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#melons">üîó</a></h2>
    <p>
      Melons are a way of storing information that derrived from the Tags Substarter's bot, Substar, used to manage.
      Currently Melons are solely managed by Amy and Ravi and split in to a couple categories, amongst them <code>programming</code> and <code>reddit</code>.
      <br>
      <br>
      Searching through the Melons is easy, type <code>!melon [search]</code> and Melon will return any findings or display exact matches:
    </p>
    <div class="imgs-container">
      <div class="wiki-img" style="width: 30%;min-width: 300px;">
        <img src="img/melon/melon-re.jpg" style="max-height: 220px;" alt="">
        <p>Clicking on any of the numbers will display the appropriate Melon.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="wiki-img" style="width: 60%;min-width: 500px;">
        <img src="img/melon/melon-redesign.jpg" style="max-height: 250px;" alt="">
        <p>The information is then displayed in an orderly fashion.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Server administrators can view the currently existing Melon categories by using the command <code>!meloncats</code> and en-/disable a particular one with <code>!enablecat [cat]</code> and <code>!disablecat [cat]</code> respectively.
      This gives a lot of control over what kind of information is shared and prioritized.
      The search engine powering Melon is Fuzzle and allows for users to search through tags which are added by Mariavi as well to supercharge the experience.
    </p>

    <h3 id="tags">Tags<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#tags">üîó</a></h3>
    <p>
      Tags are a subset of Melons in the sense that they can be configured on a per-guild basis but still run through the Melon framework to deliver the information.
      To enable the Tag feature a server admin will need to run the command <code>!enabletags</code> upon which Melon will create a role called <code>üçâ Tag Role</code> whose name can be changed, and it can be given to anyone that should have write access to the server's Tags.
      <br>
      <br>
      If the role is deleted and you would like to re-enable the feature, just call <code>!enabletags</code> again.
      <br>
      <br>
      Anyone with the role can now use <code>!addtag [key]</code>, <code>!deltag [key]</code> as well as <code>!edittag [key]</code> to perform actions on the particular server's database.
      <br>
      <br>
      Viewing a Tag is done over the Melon framework which means that you can call <code>!melon [search]</code> as usual and Melon will scan through both the enabled Melon categories as well as the server's Tags to display all the results that were found.
    </p>

    <h2 id="automoji">Automoji<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#automoji">üîó</a></h2>
    <p>
      Automojis are simple reactions that Melon will add to every message written into a certain channel!
      <br>
      <br>
      Using <code>!addemoji [emoji]</code> in the channel you want to have the setup, Melon will first add the emoji to every message made in the past and then create an entry in her database so that every message made in the future gets the emoji. This is especially useful for to-do lists and channels with a voting system.
      If you try to add an emoji that isn't valid, she will let you know and if the emoji is already setup, the same thing.
      <br>
      <br>
      To remove an emoji you can simply use the command <code>!remoji [emoji]</code> that will retroactively remove all the emojis previously added as well as the entry in the database, if nothing was found, you'll be notified.
    </p>
    <div class="img-container">
      <div class="wiki-img">
        <img src="img/melon/automoji.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Automojis allow channels to have persistent emojis and aren't limited to messages by the bot.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2 id="poll">Poll<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#poll">üîó</a></h2>
    <p>
      Melon has a couple of commands and features that allow users to setup poll channels as well as evaluate the results of a poll after it has taken place.
      <br>
      <br>
      One command is <code>!poll [id, channel]</code> which works similarly to <code>!quote</code>, in terms of what arguments it takes, but instead of a minified version of the reactions you see a full breakdown of who pressed what reaction:
    </p>
    <div class="img-container">
      <div class="wiki-img">
        <img src="img/melon/poll.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The <code>!poll</code> command shows you a breakdown of all the reactions pressed in a poll.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      In addition to using <code>!poll</code> to see a breakdown of the reactions, channels can be setup as poll channels.
      Melon will then check if a message sent/edited in the channel has any emojis (certain emojis aren't supported yet) and add those as reactions, if none were found, she will add some default emojis that can be configured, but are set to üëç and üëé in the beginning.
      <br>
      <br>
      With the command <code>!togglepoll</code> the feature can be enabled/disabled.
      If you want custom generic poll emojis, the commands <code>!adddefault [emoji]</code> and <code>!remdefault [emoji]</code> will help as they will add/remove the emojis to Melon's DB and in the case that a message in the poll channel does not have any emojis, those will be added.
    </p>
    <div class="imgs-container">
      <div class="wiki-img" style="width: 60%;min-width: 300px;">
        <img src="img/melon/poll-customoji.png" alt="">
        <p>If no emojis were found in the message, generic ones will be added.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="wiki-img" style="width: 30%;min-width: 100px;">
        <img src="img/melon/poll-messagemoji.png" alt="">
        <p>If there are emojis in the message, Melon will add those.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2 id="utility">General Utility<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#utility">üîó</a></h2>
    <p>
      Alongside the previously elaborated commands Melon has some miscellaneous utility commands which have been proven useful in the past:
      <br>
      <br>
      <code>!avatar [user]</code>: This command will return the given user's (if not specified, your own) avatar in either a <code>png</code> or URL format (for animated avatars).
      <br>
      <br>
      <code>!rand [options]</code>: If the <code>option</code> parameter follows the format <code>[int]-[int]</code> Melon will generate a random number, otherwise she will split the options with a space between them and return a random pick.
    </p>
    <h3 id="color">Color<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#color">üîó</a></h3>
    <p>
      <code>!color [amt, tolerance]</code> is a very useful command for when you want to setup roles for example or even when you're doing visual work such as web-design and need a color-palette.
      By attaching an image to the command Melon will know to turn that image into a color palette, with the default <code>amt</code> set to 4, if you need more you can always increase that and the default <code>tolerance</code> set to <code>6</code>.
      <br>
      <br>
      If you do not attach an image, Melon will scan the last 25 messages for an attachment, though currently URLs are not supported, you can use <code>!color</code> in combination with <code>!avatar</code> to get the color palette of someone's avatar.
    </p>
    <div class="img-container">
      <div class="wiki-img">
        <img src="img/melon/color.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Color will show you the most used colors in an image.</p>
