        SMART stands for "Staxel Modding and Related Tools". It's a GUI application written with Java, using the JavaFX framework, to aid in creating mods for the game Staxel as well as other useful tools.
        The application started as a simple LANG building script written in Python using a recursive algorithm to find all the <code>.tile</code> files and create an entry in the LANG file.
        <br>
        <br>
        The LANG builder now exists in the GUI as well and in addition to supporting <code>.item</code> files it allows you to edit the entries in the GUI.

      This section focuses on the technical implementation of the software's individual components to aid contributors in understanding the design of the systems.
      For information on how to use the software, such as building a lang file, go to <a href="#usage">usage</a>.

    <h3 id="filehandler">File Handler<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#filehandler">🔗</a></h3>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://github.com/Dan6erbond/SMART/blob/master/Builder/src/main/java/FileHandler.java" target="_blank">File Handler</a> is essential to many of this program's processes and contains a couple important methods that are used throughout the other classes.
      <br>
      <br>
      The method <code>getSubFolders)()</code> can be found twice. Using method-overloads you can pick whether you want to use the loop or recursive version of essentially the same method depending on whether you favor efficiency or tolerance.
      Taking a look at the <code>getSubFolders(File)</code> method, we can see it takes a single parameter of the type [File] which is the root folder in which the method should find sub-folders.
      This method is not recursive:
    </p>
    <pre src="code/getSubFolders.java"></pre>

    <p>
      As you can see, the loop runs as long as the folder being scanned has sub-folders, determined by the <code>folders.size() > 0</code> boolean expression and those sub-folders are added to the <code>directories</code> within the loop.
      To avoid duplicates, a variable <code>remove</code> of the type <code>ArrayList<File>()</code> is created in which any duplicate folders are stored and used in the <code>folders.removeAll(remove);</code> line.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      In addition to <code>getFiles(File)</code> the FileHandler contains a method <code>getFiles(String, File, boolean)</code> which allows you to get all the files within a folder (and its subfolders if the last boolean is passed as <code>true</code>) and in combination with the Lang Builder, for example, is used to find all the <code>.tile</code> and <code>.item</code> files for which a Lang file can be built:
    </p>
    <pre src="code/getFiles.java"></pre>

    <p>
      The previously shown method can thus be used as follows to get all the files from the current directory:
    </p>

    <pre src="code/getFilesExample.java"></pre>

    <p>
      The third line only adds <code>.item</code> files found in the current directory whereas the second also scans for <code>.tile</code> files in the sub directories.
    </p>

    <h3 id="staxelobject">Staxel Object<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#staxelobject">🔗</a></h3>
    <p>
      <code>StaxelObject</code> is an interface used throughout the project that represents a simple <code>.tile</code> or <code>.item</code> mod.
      Its main purpose is to, for example, allow the Lang Builder to create entries for both Tile and Item mods since the general structure remains the same.
      The most important methods it contains are the <code>getLang()</code> as well as other getters and setters while any logic for parsing Lang/Object files is written into the <code>Tile</code> and <code>Item</code> class.
      <br>
      <br>
      Using the <code>StaxelObject</code> interface there's the implementation of a <code>Tile</code> mod object as well as an <code>Item</code> mod object.
      Both have yet to include all the necessary attributes to easily export back to a JSON model, which is why the <code>org.json</code> library is being used to simply fill in attributes instead of recreating the object when exporting.
      In addition that allows the object's <code>code</code> attribute for example to be manipulated within the Lang Builder while retaining the other attributes.
      <br>
      <br>
      Following is the example of the <code>Tile</code> object:
    </p>
    <pre src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dan6erbond/SMART/master/Builder/src/main/java/Tile.java" start="7"></pre>
    <p>
      Notworthy in this example is how the code searches for an entry in a Lang file with RegEx which can be "disabled" by using a method-overload with a different signature (for example by emitting the String parameter) for the constructor where that logic isn't included.
      That also means, though, that <code>getName()</code>, <code>getDescription()</code> and <code>getLang()</code> as well as the setters won't be reliable unless the setters are used before to sets pseudo names and descriptions.
      <br>
      <br>
      <code>Item</code> is built similarly to <code>Tile</code> with the main difference being that it's fed a <code>.item</code> file which <i>slightly</i> changes some String operations but mainly serves to retain the object-oriented approach for future implementations of GUIs and the sorts.
      Once a Mod Builder for <code>Tile</code> or <code>Item</code> files is created, these classes will have far more methods and attributes with some of them being unique which means separating them beforehand makes future additions easier.
