      Hi! I'm Ravi.
      I'm a programmer that has made a couple apps, websites and the sorts and currently makes Discord and Reddit bots amongst similar small-scale projects with one of his online friends!

      I've been programming for 5 years now. I'm well versed in C#, Java and Python, as well as know some JavaScript etc. and have experience with markup and query languages that allow me to build entire systems from scratch.
      <br>
      <br>
      In my time of programming I have made two games, four apps as well as countless smaller Windows-based applications and have recently got into making smart bots for services like Reddit and Discord which is when I really started learning how to use Linux, Python and setting up my very own hosting server!

      I'm currently quite invested in <a href="mariavi.html" style="text-decoration: underline;">Mariavi</a> which is a developer team I formed with Amy and we're currently working on a bot that goes by the name <u>Banhammer</u>.
      <br>
      <br>
      Personally I also work on tons of mini-projects such as the Staxel-Mod-Builder or Fuzzle to further work on my programming and logic skills as well as build my portfolio.
    </p>

      I currently study at the Alte Kantonsschule Aarau as well as go to the engineering classes in the Berufsschule Baden as my goal is to become a programmer hopefully to work in the field of data analysis as I'm quite interested in statistics and general AI applications.
      <br>
      <br>
      Prior to visiting the AKSA and BBB I was at the Bezirksschule in Zofingen which I got into early as I skipped a grade and since the 8th grade I've been programming, primarily in object-oriented languages such as C# and Java though my curiosity has lead me to work in environments where object-based thinking isn't the main aspect.
