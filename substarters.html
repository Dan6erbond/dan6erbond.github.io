        Substarters is a Discord-based Reddit community <b>by Redditors for Redditors</b>.
        Its main purpose being to help new and old subreddits get their feet off the ground as well as help people moderate subreddits.
        <br>
        <br>
        The members of the community help each other out by delivering tips on topics ranging from moderation to initial setup, suggestions on rules - anything you can think of.
        These tips don't only come from the Substarters team and Astronauts either!
        Everyone is part of the community and to encourage helping out, the team has implemented <a href="#starma">Starma</a>.

      <p style="flex:1;min-width: 250px;">
        Currently the server has around 150 members, of which around 50 of them are signed up as Helpers.
        We've had over 40 subreddits join us so far and some of them are now running on a fully autonomous community and show admirable activity.
        <br>
        <br>
        In addition there are many people with previous experience in moderating subreddits as well as tons of newcomers, so as in the true Substarters spirit, we have a wide variety of community members and are a very active community.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The server is broken into 5 important areas:
      <ul>
        <li>Uncategorized: This is where people come to chat, sign up for roles in <code>#🔘roles</code> as well as view the announcements.</li>
        <li>Fun: Here people can introduce themselves by writing an introduction in <code>#👋introductions</code> so we can get to know more about each other as well as run polls in <code>#📊poll</code>.</li>
        <li>About: If something isn't clear or you want to learn more about the team, check out these channels!</li>
        <li>Help & Support: If you need help creating a bot, designing CSS or the likes, we'll help you here! Of course, if there's a lot of help you need for a specific subreddit, it's best you use <code>!addsub</code> and have the bot create a dedicated channel for your subreddit.</li>
        <li>Subreddits: Here every subreddits gets their very own channel where any help they need can be discussed and roles are pinged to get as many community members onboard the process as possible.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      Substarters currently utilizes two bots made by Mariavi for which the documentation can be found <a href="mariavi/sbsbots.html">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="starma">Starma<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#starma">🔗</a></h2>
    <p>
      Starma is the Substarters equivalent to Reddit karma.
      With the exception that it can only be positive and a little bit more limiting than Reddit Karma.
      <br>
      <br>
      Regular members receive 3 stars a day to give others, Astronauts receive 5.
      Starma cannot be given to yourself or the Mariavi team and should be limited to awarding helpful users and/or creativity.
      <br>
      <br>
      With <code>!star [user]</code> you can award a user Starma points and with <code>!starma</code> you can see your own Starma stats:
    </p>
    <div class="img-container">
      <div class="wiki-img">
        <img src="img/substarters/starma.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Substarters uses Starma to incentivize being helpful.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Every 24 hours, <a href="mariavi/sbsbots.html#substar">Substar</a> will analyze the users based on how much Starma they've given, how much Starma they've received etc. and regenerates the leaderboard:
    </p>
    <div class="img-container">
      <div class="wiki-img">
        <img src="img/substarters/leaderboard.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The leaderboard shows the most active Starma users for the day/overall.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      The Starma information is stored in a very simple JSON DB that follows the following structure:
    </p>
    <pre src="mariavi/code/starma-structure.json"></pre>

    <h2 id="astronauts">Astronauts<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#astronauts">🔗</a></h2>
    <p>
      Astronauts is what Substarters calls their mods.
      Their main job is being helpful and helping out the admins when there's a lot to do.
      In return Astronauts gets 5 Stars a day to give out (Which we encourage them to do when someone's helpful!) and have access to Submoon's findings.
      You too, can become an Astronaut.
      Just be helpful and we'll notice you!
