    <h3 id="creation">Creating a server<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#creation">üîó</a></h3>
    <p>
      Creating a server is easy!
      Use this big button to get started and then follow <a href="https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/204849977-How-do-I-create-a-server-" target="_blank">Discord's official tutorial</a> to create a basic server.
      Make sure you select a server region that's close to where you are to reduce lag and ping times:
    </p>
    <div class="img-container">
      <div class="wiki-img"  style="max-width: 150px">
        <img src="img/discord/create-server.png" alt="">
        <p>Starting creating a server with this button which can be found below your server-list.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      After that you'll be greeted by a server with two channels: <code>#general</code> and <code>#voice</code>
      <br>
      <br>
      Now that you have your very own server, it's time to customize it.
      Follow the steps below to get the server exactly where you want it!
    </p>
    <h3 id="settings">Accessing the server settings<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#settings">üîó</a></h3>
    <p>
      Now that you have your own server, you'll probably want to take a look at its settings to edit stuff like the icon and <a href="#roles">roles</a>.
      For that click on the icon to the right of your server's name in the sidebar (left of the chat box) and select 'Server Settings':
    </p>
    <div class="img-container">
      <div class="wiki-img">
        <img src="img/discord/server-dropdown.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The dropdown allows you to acess the server's setting and more.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2 id="chancats">Setting up channels and categories<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#chancats">üîó</a></h2>
    <p>
      Channels and categories are the most important part about a server.
      They'll help you keep your server organized and separate topics and most importantly, allow you to hide topics based on permissions.
      <br>
      <br>
      To create a channel or category, right-click on the sidebar of your server and select the one you wish to create:
    </p>
    <div class="img-container">
      <div class="wiki-img" style="max-width: 250px">
        <img src="img/discord/server-options.png" alt="">
        <p>Right-click on your server's sidebar to create a channel or category.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Creating a channel will ask you if you want to create a text- or voice-channel.
      As you'd expect, text-channels don't allow users to connect with each other over Discord's voice-chat and vice-versa.
      <br>
      <br>
      When creating either of the two, you additionally get the option to make it 'private'.
      Selecting that option will show you a list of roles for which the channel/category will then be visible.
      Everyone else won't have read/send access to the newly created item:
    </p>
    <div class="img-container">
      <div class="wiki-img">
        <img src="img/discord/private-category-roles.jpg" alt="">
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      If you're unhappy with the position of the newly created channel or category, you can hold and drag it around with your mouse and drop it to the desired position.
    </p>
    <h3 id="categories">Categories<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#categories">üîó</a></h3>
    <p>
      Categories are like containers for your text- and voice-channels.
      They allow you to group relevant ones together and setup permissions that will be taken over by the category's channels unless you wish to override them.
      <br>
      <br>
      Dragging a channel below a category will automatically make it a child of the category and if the permissions of the channel don't align with those of the category, Discord will offer you to 'sync' them which means to take over those permissions of the category.
      If the permissions aren't synced, the original permissions of the channel will be kept.
    </p>
    <h3 id="channels">Channels<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#channels">üîó</a></h3>
    Permissions, invites and webhooks are topics that will be discussed in further detail in their own sections.
    This section focuses on the specific options a text-/voice-channel has that can be configured.
    <h4 id="text-channels">Text Channels<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#text-channels">üîó</a></h4>
    <p>
      Text channels are where users can post, well, text!
      Hovering over a text-channel will reveal a tooth-weel that allows you to configure it:
    </p>
    <div class="img-container">
      <div class="wiki-img" style="max-width: 250px">
        <img src="img/discord/channel-hover.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Hovering over a channel allows you to enter its settings.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      There are a few key settings you'll want to look at and configure to your liking:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Topic:</b> This is basically a channel's description.
          It supports regular characters as well as unicode emojis.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Slowmode:</b> Slowmode, when enabled, will limit a user's message-rate.
          If it's set to 5 seconds, users can only send one message every 5 seconds.
          This can be quite useful for servers with lots of members.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>NSFW:</b> If a channel is dedicated to 18+ content, it's recommended to toggle this option as it will warn users before they join the channel.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h4 id="voice-channels">Voice Channels<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#voice-channels">üîó</a></h4>
    <p>
      üë∑‚Äç üöß Work in progress! üöß
    </p>

    <h2 id="roles">Roles<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#roles">üîó</a></h2>
    <p>
      Roles are essential to an organized server.
      They allow you to distinguish members, assign colors and of course, configure permissions for each member.
      Roles can be created and configured in the server's settings under 'Roles'.
      <br>
      <br>
      In the role configuration menu you'll see a list of roles to the left and the selected role's settings to the right.
      <code>@everyone</code> is the default "role" everyone has, it cannot be configured in terms of colors/name, but its permissions can be altered which we will go into more detail later.
      <br>
      <br>
      Selecting any other role will allow you to edit its name, which supports emojis just like channels/categories do and its color.
      A handy method of getting HEX color codes is by using <a href="mariavi/melon.html">Melon's</a> <code>!color</code> command which will show you the most common colors in an image.
      <br>
      <br>
      Additionally you can decide whether a role should be mentionable and distinguished.
      Generally you only want people to be able to mention roles that serve a functional purpose.
      A good example for that are the moderators or developers.
      <br>
      <br>
      Distinguishing a role means in addition to the name of a user with the role receiving the role's color, the user will be moved into a separate category on the user-overview.
      <br>
      <br>
      If a user has multiple roles, they will be take over the color as well as be distinguished based on the role that's the highest in the list.
      <br>
      <br>
      In terms of permissions, Discord will assign a user's permissions based on his/her highest permissions.
      Meaning that if a user has three roles, one with the 'Manage Messages' permission, the user will have those permissions where they aren't configured otherwise.
    </p>

    <h2 id="permissions">Permissions<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#permissions">üîó</a></h2>
    <p>
      Discord has a fairly complex system that allows server admins to limit the members' capabilities within a certain space.
      There are three levels in the permission system, each of them can be overriden by a lower level:
      <ul>
        <li>Guild</li>
        <li>Category</li>
        <li>Channel</li>
      </ul>
      This means that it's recommended to configure a role/member's permissions on a guild-level and just override from there.
    </p>
    <h3 id="permissionsettings">Permission Settings<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#permissionsettings">üîó</a></h3>
    <p>
      Before we get to the fancy overrides, let's take a look at what permissions there are that can be configured:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Administrator:</b> Quite simple, with this permission the user can do everything to anyone except the few permissions only a server owner has.
          Namely deleting the server and changing the owner's nickname.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>View Audit Log</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Manage Server:</b> With this permission users can change the server's name and region.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Manage Roles:</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Manage Channels:</b>

        <li>
          <b>Create Instant Invite</b>

        <li>
          <b>Attach Files</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Read Message History:</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Mention Everyone:</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Use External Emojis:</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Add Reactions:</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <b>Voice</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Connect</b>
        </li>
        <li>

        <li>
          <b>Use Voice Activity</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Priority Speaker</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3 id="overrides">Overrides<a onclick="copyToClipboard(this.href);" href="#overrides">üîó</a></h3>
    <p>
      Now that you know what permissions can be assigned to a user/role, it's time to setup overrides.
      <br>
      <br>
      Overrides are simple once you've gotten the hang of them, the basic idea is that you have guild-wide permissions that will be used <u>most</u> of the time and those are overriden in the cases where different settings are required.
      <br>
      <br>
      This usually means you'll be more restrictive on the guild-level and give users limited permissions for a channel or category.
      <br>
      <br>
      As previously mentioned, once a user has a permission, it doesn't matter what other roles the user has.
      This means that basic permissions should be setup with <code>@everyone</code>, namely those that, well, everyone should have.
      <br>
      <br>
      On the guild-level permissions can only be enabled/disabled.
      To override them, you go to a category or channel's settings and change the permission for a user/roles.
      By default the permission is set to "/", if you want to enable it for a certain area, it will need to be set to ‚úî and to disable it, change it to ‚ùå.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Examples:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The role <code>@coders</code> does <u>not</u> have the permission to manage messages on the guild-level, but you'd like them to have that only in the coding channel.
        For that you right-click on the channel, select 'Edit Channel' and then go to the 'Permissions' tab.
        Over there you can add a new role to the list, in this case the <code>@coders</code> role and assign them the 'Manage Messages' permission by setting it to ‚úî.
      </li>
      <li>
        You don't want most of the server to be visible to people without the <code>@verified redditors</code> role.
        On the guild-level you'll want to disable the 'Read Messages' permission for <code>@everyone</code> and then enable it for <code>@verified redditors</code>.
        If you have a <code>#welcome</code> channel or the sorts that you want everyone to have access to, go into its permission settings and set 'Read Messages' explicitely to ‚úî.
      </li>
      <li>
        People with the <code>@web-dev</code> role shouldn't have access to the <code>PROGRAMMING</code> category.
        If the role's guild-level permissions for 'Read Messages' are enabled, head to the <code>PROGRAMMING</code> category, add the role if it isn't already added and set the permission to ‚ùå.
      </li>
    </ol>
