      Hi! I'm Ravi.
      I'm a programmer that <s>wastes</s> invests most of his time in Reddit and Discord communities when I'm not writing Discord bots for Mariavi or writing <s>boring</s> super fun school apps!

    <h2>General</h2>

    <p>
      I've been programming for 5 years now. I'm well versed in C#, Java and Python, as well as know some JavaScript etc. and have experience with markup languages and query languages that allow me to build entire systems from scratch.
      <br>
      <br>
      In my time of programming I have made two games, four apps as well as countless smaller Windows-based applications and have recently got into making smart bots for services like Reddit and Discord which is when I really started learning how to use Linux, Python and setting up my very own hosting server!
