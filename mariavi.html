    <h2 id="about">About us</h2>
    <p>
      The devs are <b>Amy</b> and <b>Ravi</b> who both met each other through Reddit.
      Ravi saw an ad she put up for people interested in moderating her subreddit /r/casualChildAbuse (RIP - 2019) and volunteered.
      They quickly became friends and started chatting about all their /r/CrazyIdeas such as a bot that would let them moderate the subreddit at the time.
      A concept quickly became reality and soon enough, /r/casualChildAbuse was being run through Discord.
      It would allow the mod-team to vote on things easier and get pinged through reports and new items. They were able to step up our moderation game quite a bit.
      That bot has now been expanded into the project Mariavi calls <b>The Banhammer Bot</b> and the more the two talked, the more projects that emerged.
      They decided to give their digital friendship and dev team a name to work under, and shuffled the letters from their names and <b>Mariavi</b> was born.

            <b>The Banhammer Bot</b> is a Discord bot, currently in development, that allows Reddit moderators to moderate their subreddit from within Discord.
            <br>
            It has been inspired the concept of the bot we used to use back at /r/casualChildAbuse and is very simple to setup! Simply invite it to your Discord server and use <code>!addsub</code> to add your subreddit to it's database.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Important:</b> /u/TheBanhammerBot needs to be a moderator of your subreddit in order to function properly.

            <b>Reddify</b> is a Discord bot, that intends to connect your Reddit account with your Discord one via 2FA. Simply use <code>!verify</code> to have it send you a message and respond with "verify" to the message in Reddit and Reddify will take care of the rest!

            <b>She</b> is capable of storing "Melons" categorized by the devs that can be summoned by typing <code>!melon [search]</code>.
            She will then find the closest matches and if there isn't a 100% match, offer you to select one of them with reactions.
            <br>
            <br>
            Other handy feature include reaction-roles: use <code>!addreactrole [emoji, role, msg, channel]</code> to have her add a reaction to a message that allows users to sign-up for roles in that server!
