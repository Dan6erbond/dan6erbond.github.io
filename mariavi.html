    <h2 id="about">About us</h2>
    <p>
      The devs are <b>Amy</b> and <b>Ravi</b> who both met each other through Reddit.
      Ravi saw an ad she put up for people interested in moderating her subreddit /r/casualChildAbuse (RIP - 2019) and volunteered.
      They quickly became friends and started chatting about all their /r/CrazyIdeas such as a bot that would let them moderate the subreddit at the time.
      A concept quickly became reality and soon enough, /r/casualChildAbuse was practically being run through Discord.
      It would allow the mod-team to vote on things easier and get pinged through reports and new items.
      They were able to step up our moderation game quite a bit.
      <br>
      <br>
      After /r/casualChildAbuse was quarantined and the moderator team parted ways, Amy and Ravi thought about creating a more customizeable version of the Discord moderation bot which they called <b>Banhammer</b>.
      A couple weeks into the project security flaws were discovered and the project was put to a hault and <b>Reddify</b> was born to ensure a secure connection between Discord and Reddit via 2FA.
      As they took on more projects such as revamping <u>Substarters</u> they decided to give their digital friendship a name and by mixing letters of their names, Mariavi was born.
      <br>
      <br>
      With time they took on more and more projects such as <b>Substarters</b> - a community for Reddit users and moderators alike with the main goal of helping the communities grow as well as others!
      Substarters got a facelift when Mariavi was founded with bots that automated simple processes as well as <u>Tags</u> which were a way for information to be searched and added to and from a database that the moderator team had access to.
      The Tags have since been moved to the <b>Melon</b> - a utility bot for Discord servers that <u>Substarters</u> makes good use of.
      <br>
      <br>
      Since then they take custom bot requests for a <i>fee</i> and are open to teaching you how to code for <u>free</u> as well as share bots and ideas with the community to encourage the creation of <b><u>good bots</u></b> on Reddit and Discord alike.
      They have a <a href="https://discord.gg/XyKZgzN">Discord server</a> which you are always welcome to join and Amy has a <a href="http://wiki.lydocia.com/2019/mariavi/">website</a> of her own! Check it out!

            <b>The Banhammer Bot</b> is a Discord bot, currently in development, that allows Reddit moderators to moderate their subreddit from within Discord.
            <br>
            It has been inspired the concept of the bot we used to use back at /r/casualChildAbuse and is very simple to setup! Simply invite it to your Discord server and use <code>!addsub</code> to add your subreddit to it's database.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Important:</b> /u/TheBanhammerBot needs to be a moderator of your subreddit in order to function properly.

            Other handy feature include reaction-roles: use <code>!addreactrole [emoji, role, msg, channel]</code> to have her add a reaction to a message that allows users to sign-up for roles in that server!
