            I know I said this over on Reddit already but you truly are one of
            the most amazing people I've ever met. It would literally be
            impossible to list all the things I love about you, but you're
            genuinely the best friend I've ever had and I couldn't ask for more.

            I know this year has been incredibly messy and hard but we've
            managed to communicate and stay by each other's side through all of
            it and it means the world to me. I know someday we'll be able to
            look back at all of this and see how much it's taught us, and for
            now we just have to pull through. But I know with you by my side
            I'll always manage.

            I've been collecting and have an amazing birthday!!! ðŸ˜Š
